# cpp
basic c++ programs for beginers to advance users
question for program is that:
You have array of all zeros with size of N. You will get q queries. in each query we have 2 no. 'l' and 'r'. Increase all value from [l,r] by 1.
for example your array is [0 0 0 0], and you have 2 queries, [2,3] and [1,3]. then final array should be [0 1 2 2 ].
